# SPEC-1-Pickleball-Session-App

## Background

Pickleball is a fast-growing sport where casual players often need a quick and fair way to organize matches. Currently, it is cumbersome for players to manage sessions manually, keep track of who is playing, and create balanced teams. The proposed app will streamline this by allowing players to create sessions, dynamically add or remove players, and automatically generate matches.

The app will:

- Let a session owner (or group) manage players.
- Enable multiple matches to be played in parallel.
- Initially create teams randomly, with room to expand toward more advanced matchmaking logic in the future.

---

## Requirements

**Must Have**

- Users can create a pickleball session.
- Users can join or leave a session.
- Session owner can add or remove players at any time.
- Users can generate a new round inside a session.
- When a round is generated, the system forms 2 vs 2 matches from the current player pool.
- Players already assigned to an active match are unavailable until that match ends.
- Multiple matches can run simultaneously in the same session.

**Should Have**

- Ability to mark a match as completed so players return to the available pool.
- Session persists in Supabase (real-time updates across clients).
- Basic player identifiers (name, maybe avatar).

**Could Have**

- More sophisticated matchmaking logic (based on skill, past matches, or fairness).
- Session chat or notes.
- Push notifications for match readiness.

## Method

### High-Level Architecture

- **React Native App**: UI for creating sessions, adding/removing players, generating rounds, viewing matches.
- **Supabase Backend**: Manages persistence (Postgres), realtime sync (Supabase Realtime), and lightweight auth (anonymous).
- **Matchmaking Logic**: Runs in the client (for MVP) to randomly generate teams.

### Database Schema (Supabase / Postgres)

#### `sessions`

| column     | type      | notes             |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| id (PK)    | uuid      | unique session id |
| name       | text      | session name      |
| created_at | timestamp | default now()     |

#### `players`

| column       | type      | notes                          |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| id (PK)      | uuid      | player id                      |
| session_id   | uuid (FK) | belongs to a session           |
| name         | text      | player name                    |
| is_available | boolean   | true if not in an active match |

#### `matches`

| column       | type      | notes                        |
| ------------ | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| id (PK)      | uuid      | match id                     |

| round_number | int       | round index inside a session |
| status       | text      | "active" or "completed"      |
| created_at   | timestamp |                              |

#### `match_players`

| column         | type | notes               |
| -------------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| id (PK)        | uuid | unique id           |
| match_id (FK)  | uuid | belongs to a match  |
| player_id (FK) | uuid | belongs to a player |
| team           | int  | 1 or 2              |

### Matchmaking Algorithm (MVP)

1. Query all **available players** in the session.
2. Randomly shuffle them.
3. Take 4 players at a time → create a match.
4. Assign 2 to team A, 2 to team B.
5. Set those players’ `is_available = false`.
6. Repeat until fewer than 4 players remain.

---

## Implementation

1. **Project Setup**

   - Initialize React Native project (`expo` recommended for speed).
   - Add Supabase JS client (`@supabase/supabase-js`).
   - Configure Supabase URL + anon key.

2. **Database Setup (Supabase)**

   - Create tables: `sessions`, `players`, `matches`, `match_players`.
   - Add foreign key constraints (`session_id`, `player_id`).
   - Enable **Realtime** on these tables.

3. **Core Features**

   - **Create Session**: Insert new row in `sessions`.
   - **Join Session**: Insert into `players`.
   - **Add / Remove Players**: Insert/delete in `players`.
   - **Generate Round**:
     - Client fetches all available players.
     - Runs matchmaking algorithm.
     - Inserts into `matches` + `match_players`.
     - Updates `players.is_available=false` for selected players.
   - **Complete Match**:
     - Update `matches.status="completed"`.
     - Set `players.is_available=true`.

4. **Realtime Sync**

   - Subscribe to `players` and `matches` tables.
   - Auto-refresh UI when changes occur.

5. **UI Components**

   - **Session List Screen**: View/create sessions.
   - **Session Detail Screen**: Player list + match list.
   - **Match Detail Screen**: View teams and mark as complete.
   - **Floating Action Button**: Generate new round.

6. **UI Library**
   - Use **NatievWind**.

## Gathering Results

To verify that the system meets the requirements, we will focus on functional validation and user experience feedback:

**Functional Validation**

- ✅ Users can create and join sessions without authentication.
- ✅ Players can be added/removed dynamically and changes reflect across devices in realtime.
- ✅ Generating a round correctly assigns available players into 2 vs 2 matches.
- ✅ Players already in matches are unavailable until their match completes.
- ✅ Multiple matches can run concurrently without data conflicts.
- ✅ Completing a match correctly returns players to the available pool.

**User Experience Checks**

- ✅ UI updates seamlessly when changes happen (no manual refresh needed).
- ✅ Generating rounds feels fast (<1s on client).
- ✅ Adding/removing players feels intuitive and responsive.

**Performance & Reliability**

- ✅ Supabase realtime handles updates across 5–10 clients without delay.
- ✅ No data inconsistencies in concurrent actions (e.g., two people generating a round simultaneously).
- ✅ App works reliably on both iOS and Android test devices.

**Feedback Loop**

- Conduct test sessions with small groups (4–12 players).
- Gather feedback on ease of use, clarity of UI, and fairness of random team assignments.
- Use findings to prioritize future enhancements (e.g., smarter matchmaking, chat, notifications).
